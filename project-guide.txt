SECTION 3 : STEP 10: Udemy : Ranga : Java Fullstack with Angular and Spring

1) how to create a component using ng generate component component_name or ng g c component_name
Example : ng g c welcome
The above syntax will automatically create a component called WelcomeComponent
As the component is created, in console we can see the log as there are 4 files created (welcome.component.html,.component.specs.ts,.component.ts, .component.css,  and 1 file updated (src/app/app.module.ts)

Every Angular component (@Component) in a project has to be associated with Angular Module(@NgModule) inside declarations array.

2) once the component is created or added to the project, we cannot roll it back, so it is very important to get the correct names for component.Sim

3) Similarly like java, in Typescript if a class implements an interface, then we have to implement all the methods of that interface or need to make it abstract method.

export class WelcomeComponent implements OnInit

4) we have included WelcomeComponet inside AppComponent through app-welcome selector using it inside app.component.html (<app-welcome></app-welcome>)
To show one component(WelcomeComponent) inside another component (AppComponent) then selector of the WelcomeComponent(app-welcome) needs to be used inside view [app.component.html (<app-welcome></app-welcome>)]
